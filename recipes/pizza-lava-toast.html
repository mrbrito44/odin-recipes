    <h1>Pizza Lava Toast Recipe</h1>
    <img src="../img/pizza.webp" alt="two slices of bread cover in melted cheese" width="750" height="563">
    <p>First, you toast two pieces of bread, then you put a cheese boarder around the outside of one toast (leaving the
        middle empty), stack the other piece of toast on top and using the back of spoon, push down on the center of the
        top toast to create a crater in the center. Fill the crater up with sauce, then top the whole thing with more
        cheese and the pizza toppings of your choice (like pepperoni, peppers, onions, mushrooms—the sky's the limit!).
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 teaspoons butter</li>
        <li>2 slices sourdough bread</li>
        <li>1 ½ ounces sliced mozzarella cheese, divided</li>
        <li>1/2 ounce sliced pepper jack cheese</li>
        <li>5 slices pickled jalapeno</li>
        <li>5 slices pepperoni</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon pizza sauce</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon italian seasoning, divided</li>
        <li>Crushed red pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>Ground black pepper, to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375°F. Line a sheet pan with parchment paper. Spread butter on both sides of each slice of
            bread and place on the prepared pan. Bake, flipping once halfway through, until bread is lightly browned on
            both sides, about 8 minutes. </li>
        <li>Cover the perimeter of one bread slice with half of the mozzarella cheese, leaving the middle part of the
            bread empty. Top with other slice of bread. Use the back of a spoon to make an indentation in the middle of
            the bread slices, pushing down firmly to reach the bottom slice. Add the pizza sauce to the indentation, and
            sprinkle half the Italian seasoning over the top. Cover with remaining ½ ounce mozzarella cheese and pepper
            jack, followed by jalapeño and pepperoni. Garnish with remaining Italian seasoning, crushed red pepper and
            black pepper. </li>
        <li>Bake until the cheese is melted and golden-brown, about 5 minutes. Slice in half and serve. </li>
    </ol>
